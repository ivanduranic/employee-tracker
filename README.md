This application is easy to use and understand. After cloning, installing Node.js and opening the folder in your code editor (VS Code), you need to run npm install, then create the database and tables by using db folder content (schema.sql) in your MySQL workbench.
Then, go back to the application and run node app.js. You will be prompted with everything you need to create, view, update and delete content from/to you database. Don't forget to change your database connection information like user/username and password and port if it's not the default 3306. Make sure to keep the same database name and tables as provided in db folder.
